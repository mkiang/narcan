Description: Multiple cause of death (MCOD) data are required for calculating 
    opioid deaths (which are defined by both an underlying and contributory 
    cause). This package is designed to help with some of the downloading, 
    munging, and common operations of MCOD data -- especially in relation to
    opioid deaths.
